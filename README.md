Motion Metrics

Overview: 
Motion Metrics is is an AI-powered vehicle speed detection system designed to analyze highway traffic footage.
Using the powerful YOLOv8 model, this project efficiently identifies and tracks vehicles such as cars, trucks, and bikes while calculating their relative speeds.
This solution is ideal for traffic monitoring, safety analysis, and smart transportation insights.

Features
->Object Detection with YOLOv8: Accurately detects multiple vehicle types in real-time or recorded video footage.
->Speed Estimation: Calculates the relative speed of each detected vehicle using frame-by-frame analysis and known reference points.
->Visual Overlays: Displays bounding boxes, speed annotations, and vehicle labels directly on the video feed for clear insights.
->Flexible Input Support: Accepts video files or live camera feeds for seamless data processing.
->Customizable Settings: Allows tuning detection thresholds, speed calculation parameters, and visual preferences for optimal performance.

Application
->Traffic Management: Monitor and analyze vehicle speeds on highways and urban roads.
->Safety Analysis: Identify speeding violations and dangerous driving patterns
->Research and Development: Useful for computer vision studies, AI-based surveillance projects, and transportation analytics.
